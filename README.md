# While challenge

You have three tasks to complete

Note - these will not be autograded

You will need to test yourself to ensure they work

## Task 1 - Password guesser

The task has a predefined "password" variable with the value "Password123"

You must a code that uses a second variable, called "guess", to store a users input at guessing the password

You must use a while loop to keep asking the user to guess the password until they get it correct

When the user gets it wrong the output should be "Password incorrect, try again!", when they get it correct the output should be "Password cracked!"

You may **not** use a for loop or an if statement

## Task 2 - Times Table

This function should ask the user for two inputs

The first one should ask them to select a times table

The second one should ask them how many terms to calcualte

You should use a while loop to output the timestable up to the specfied number of terms

For example, if the user input 7, then 4, the output should be

7

14

21

28

## Task 3 - Mississippis

Use a while loop to count to five

The screen should output 1 Mississippi to 5 Mississippi as it counts

You must also use the time.sleep function to make the while loop pause for 1 second each time
